Bugs Reported (nor reproduced):
 *. In 1670 mode, ATFx should be like ATE, but for terminal mode
 *. Test incoming network packets of various sizes at different periods
 
New Features:
  *. Default Echo off in phonebook creation.
  *. Add gopher client, or at least at&g type gopher command (gopher://?)
  *. SHELL wget command.
  *. SLIP support?
  *. PPP support?
  *. @19200, on C64 modem, extend start bit by 30 cycles
  *. Baud rate test command (what good is this? how do you send cmd if baud is wrong?!)
  *. SSL/SSH server sockets? 
  *. LYNX-like browser?

New hardware hopes:
 C+B 0 FLAG2+PB0	RxD	Receive Data (Must be applied to both pins!)
 D!  1 RTS	Ready To Send
 F!  3 RI	Ring Indicator (1650 ring indicator - output of modem -> input of computer )
 H!	4 DCD	Data Carrier Detect
 J!   5 1650 Pulse Dial Pin (output of computer -> input to modem)
 +K	6 CTS	Clear To Send
 M!	8 TxD	Transmit Data

Hangup 1660: poke56579,38:poke56577,32 (drive bit 32 high)

Call Detect on 1650/1660:
Wait for bit 8 (or 16?) to go low, then:
1660: poke56579,38:pokeoh,4 -- (drive bit 32 low, leave bit 4 high)
1650: poke56579,38:pokeoh,4 -- (drive bit 32 high, bit 4 low)
After ring, SCBBS drives bits 4, 32 and 64 high, the rest low. (DTR and RTS and OTH high)
